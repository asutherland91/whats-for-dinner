# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
This application helps people answer the age-old question: what's for dinner? Using this app you can select either side dish, main dish, dessert, or full meal and the app will generate random ideas for you. If you don't like any of them you can just randomize again and get a whole new set. If you want to clear the page you can just hit the clear button and the page will reset the page to how it was when it was first loaded.

### Installation Instructions:
 1. Open the github repository “whats-for-dinner”.
 2. Fork the repository.
 3. On the forked repository page click on the green “<>Code” button and copy the SSH key.
 4. In your own terminal go to the directory in which you wish to clone this repository to.
 5. Once there type “git clone” and paste in the SSH key.
 6. Next go to the directory that it is inside of and open the “index.html” in your browser, from there you should be able to use the application as intended.

### Learning Goals:
The listed learning goals were to gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp. Understand how to listen to and respond to user events, and to individualize your programming skill set. I worked with the above tech, this is the first time working extensively with CSS or HTML, and I do think that I was able to grow as a developer throughout this project.

### Wins + Challenges:

I had a really really hard time getting my clear button to not move when the meal names appeared. I did a decent amount of reading about positions and eventually moved my button so that it was outside of the shared div and gave it position: absolute, and then I gave my outer white box a position: relative. As far as I was able to understand because the outer white box is static; it doesn’t move, basing my clear button’s position off of it’s position meant that it wouldn’t move either. I think that was both my greatest challenge, and my greatest win.

I also struggled greatly with getting things in the layout correct. The font size, the spacing. It was all very difficult for me. When I finally got it to a place where I thought it was correct I’d realize something else was wrong. After a really long time I finally got it to look correct and I was so excited about it.
